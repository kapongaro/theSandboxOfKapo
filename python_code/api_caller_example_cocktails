#Using the requests package to interact with an API is as simple as providing the following parameters: type, url, headers and the query
#e.g. r = requests.request(type, url, headers=headers, query=query)

import requests as requests

#set the url and the headers
url = "https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?f=a"
h = {"X-API-Key": "1"}

#send the request to the url with the associated headers.
r = requests.request("GET",url,headers=h)

#convert result to json format
r_json = r.json()

#From here, you can manipulate the result to provide whatever you need.
